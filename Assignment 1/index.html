    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>After completing this simulation experiment on free vibration of a cantilever beam one should be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Model a given real system to an equivalent simplified model of a cantilever beam with suitable assumptions / idealizations.
        </li>
        <li>Calculate the logarithmic decrement, damping ratio, damping frequency and natural frequency of the system
        </li>
        <li>Find the stiffness and the critical damping of the system.
        </li>
        <li>Calculate damping coefficient of the system.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A system is said to be a cantilever beam system if one end of the system is rigidly fixed to a support and the other end is free to move. A real system is shown below, try to make suitable assumptions to deduce the system to a cantilever beam.

<p>Vibration analysis of a cantilever beam system is important as it can explain and help us analyse a number of real life systems. As shown in above examples, real systems can be simplified to a cantilever beam, thereby helping us make design changes accordingly for the most efficient systems.</p>
<h2>Natural Frequency of Cantilever Beam</h2>
<p>When given an excitation and left to vibrate on its own, the frequency at which a cantilever beam will oscillate is its natural frequency. This condition is called Free vibration. The value of natural frequency depends only on system parameters of mass and stiffness. When a real system is approximated to a simple cantilever beam, some assumptions are made for modelling and analysis (Important assumptions for undamped system are given below):
<ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li> The mass (m) of the whole system is considered to be lumped at the free end of the beam</li>
    <li> No energy consuming element (damping) is present in the system i.e. undamped vibration</li>
    <li> The complex cross section and type of material of the real system has been simplified to equate to a Cantilever beam</li>
    <li> The governing equation for such a system (spring mass system without damping under free vibration) is as below:</li> </p>
</ul>

<p>where, m is the mass of the system, k is the stiffness of the system and x is the displacement of the system from its equilibrium position. The natural frequency of the system is given by:</p>
